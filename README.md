# What is this repository about?
This is the source code repository for Game Miner. You can check what is game miner and how to use it at [Game Miner Public](https://github.com/hexdump2002/game-miner-public)

# What is the state of Game Miner source repsitory?
Game miner has been developed using Flutter 3 and source code matches the latest release in the public repository. To build it, you just need to install Flutter and with a bit of luck you will be able to compile it on your own.

I was delaying the publishing of this repository with the hope of cleaning code a bit and lower the barrier for people to contribute but after 2 months I wasn't able to do it so, this is why I am making the repository public "as it is"

I will accept any pull request but the merging will take a bit of time because of the lack of time I'm experiencing.
